# Weather-App
It is a basic-built weather app, it's made out of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, gettind the API data from weathermap.org
The API function in JavaScript works with the data of OpenWeatherMap.org, not to much to say, just keep all the files in the same folder, either way, you have to change the href property in the html file
